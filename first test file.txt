Dear Prof.Matuszynska,
Happy new year to you too! Yes, this is my first week here in Paris, and I am excited to start.

The registration form is not opening in any of my devices. I think the format is neither .pdf nor .doc. 

I would be happy to provide information for the news section. I will try to formulate and send it by the end of this week.

Thank you for adding me on Slack. I will see you tomorrow in the seminar. 
Thank you for your best wishes and s first file
